get Sample class working

- make empty loaded_samples array
- loop through packs and sample headers,
- and for each one:
  - firstly, as proof of concept
  - initialise Sample object using constructor
    - that means assigning all sampler, env, filter, panner, analyser objects
    - chaining them
  -

use play method to trigger sample

OR

- get chooseSample working
- get playSample working through sampler

<!-- todo -->

Get sequence working.

- try sequence as Sample attribute
- Replicate Skunkworks, not using onMount so far as possible, and simplifying.
- Choose sample, have it load correct sequence
- try Sample class: initialise, play, dispose methods

- check sample urls
- choose emojis

# issues

grids and mojis don't behave well when zoomed â€“ use rem for tile size?
