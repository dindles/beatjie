## todo

<!-- todo next -->

– related to the next point, i think that the wrong sample is being played, and the wrong one selected (wrong relative to display). need to make sure everything is connected properly

- sample.ids are a bit fiddly – we got an OBO, how to use ids as key, not index?

- Sequences

<!-- todo -->

change panner to channel, get env working
Get sequence working.

- try sequence as Sample attribute
- Replicate Skunkworks, not using onMount so far as possible, and simplifying.
- Choose sample, have it load correct sequence
- try Sample class: initialise, play, dispose methods

- check sample urls
- choose emojis

# issues

grids and mojis don't behave well when zoomed – use rem for tile size?
