A simple sample player and sequancer using Svelte 5 and Tone.js.
Make beats, have fun!

- Matt DesLauriers @mattdesl made a page of beautiful, simple, progressive Tone.js demos which were a godsend when i was learning about Tone, especially in relation to implementing effects and the visual analyser.
- Max Fung's (https://github.com/mxfng) drumhaus (https://www.drumha.us/) is the most gorgeous, sophisticated implementation of a drum sequencer I've seen online (_those knobs!_). His code is also neat and easy to follow. I'm particularly indebted to his approach to structuring and processing samples and packs [see models.svelte.ts and the 'called immediately' functions in page.svelte].
  â€“ the design of the app is heavily inspired by fors.fm's design language, and Opal in particular.
