## Thanks

- Matt DesLauriers ([@mattdesl](https://github.com/mattdesl)) made a page (https://tone-demos.glitch.me/) of elegant, simple, progressive Tone.js demos which were very helpful while I was learning about Tone, especially in relation to implementing effects and the visual analyser.
- Max Fung's [@mxfng](https://github.com/mxfng) drumhaus (https://www.drumha.us/) is a gorgeous, sophisticated implementation of a drum sequencer (_those knobs!_). His code is neat and easy to grasp. I'm particularly indebted to his approach to structuring and processing samples and packs.
- Beatjie's design is inspired by, but can't compare to, [fors' apps](https://fors.fm/), specifically Opal.
- I used Anthropic's Claude 3.5, 4 and 4.5 extensively through the process of making Beatjie and learning more about creative development for the web.
