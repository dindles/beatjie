# Beatjie

A simple sample player and sequencer using Svelte 5 and Tone.js.

Make beats, have fun!

## Thanks

- Matt DesLauriers ([@mattdesl](https://github.com/mattdesl)) made a page (https://tone-demos.glitch.me/) of beautiful, simple, progressive Tone.js demos which were very helpful when i was learning about Tone, especially in relation to implementing effects and the visual analyser.
- Max Fung's [@mxfng](https://github.com/mxfng) drumhaus (https://www.drumha.us/) is a gorgeous, sophisticated implementation of a drum sequencer (_those knobs!_). His code is neat and easy to grasp. I'm particularly indebted to his approach to structuring and processing samples and packs.
  – Beatjie's design is inspired by [fors' apps](https://fors.fm/), specifically Opal.
  – I used Anthropic's Claude 3.5 and 4 extensively through the process of making Beatjie and learning more about creative development for the web. It's a good time to be a hobbyist coder.
