# Beatjie

A simple sample player and sequencer using Svelte 5 and Tone.js.

Make beats, have fun!

## Thanks

- Matt DesLauriers @mattdesl made a page (https://tone-demos.glitch.me/) of beautiful, simple, progressive Tone.js demos which were very helpful when i was learning about Tone, especially in relation to implementing effects and the visual analyser.
- Max Fung's (https://github.com/mxfng) drumhaus (https://www.drumha.us/) is a gorgeous, sophisticated implementation of a drum sequencer (_those knobs!_). His code is also neat and easy to follow. I'm particularly indebted to his approach to structuring and processing samples and packs.
  â€“ Beatjie's design is greatly inspired by fors.fm's work.
