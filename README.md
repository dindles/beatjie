- Matt DesLauriers @mattdesl made a page of beautiful, simple, progressive tone.js demos which were very helpful when i was learning about tone, and especially how to implement effects and the visual analyser.
- Max Fung's (https://github.com/mxfng) drumhaus (https://www.drumha.us/)is the most gorgeous, sophisticated implementation of a drum sequencer I've seen online (those knobs!). His code is also beautiful and easy to follow. I'm particularly indebted to drumhaus's approach to structuring and processing samples and packs [see src/lib/models.svelte.ts and the ].
